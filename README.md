# Giulio Fabbri

### Description
I am an Italian emerging professional with almost a year of experience in the data sector, living in Dublin. 
My academic background in statistics and economics at the undergraduate level, along with my intentional MSc in Data Science, has provided me with a strong foundation for tackling complex data challenges. In addition, my experience studying abroad and working with international teams has further enhanced my ability to collaborate across cultures, allowing me to gain valuable insights and experiences, even as I am early in my career.
My passion has always been analyzing the economic phenomena that shape our society, and I strongly believe that a scientific approach to data is key to solving the economic, environmental, and social challenges we face in today's world.
